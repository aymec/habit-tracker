# Privacy Policy for OnTrack

**Last Updated: January 12, 2026**

Your privacy is critically important to us. At **OnTrack**, we have a simple philosophy: your data belongs to you.

### 1. Data Collection and Storage

**OnTrack - Habit Tracker** is designed to function as a local-only application.

* **Personal Data:** We do not require you to create an account or provide any personal information (such as name, email, or phone number) to use the app.
* **Habit Data:** All data you input regarding your habits, streaks, and schedules is stored **locally on your device**.
* **No Server Storage:** We do not operate any external servers to collect, store, or process your habit data.

### 2. Data Sharing

Since we do not collect your data, we cannot and do not sell, trade, or share your information with any third parties.

### 3. Third-Party Services

The app is built using **React Native and Expo**. While the app itself does not collect data, the underlying operating system (iOS/Android) or the app store (Google Play/Apple App Store) may collect basic telemetry or crash reports as governed by their own privacy policies.

### 4. Data Retention and Deletion

Your data stays on your device for as long as the app is installed. If you delete the **OnTrack** app, all locally stored habit data will be permanently deleted by the operating system. We cannot recover this data for you as we never had access to it.

### 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.

### 6. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can reach out via GitHub by opening an issue in the project repository.
